Taylor's baby was born right when this project was assigned and therefore
was tied up for the most part (understandably).  He contributed to the report
but has helped us greatly in the proceeding projects!  We just wanted to let
you know why he didn't contribute as much this time.  He has been a great
asset to the group this semester!
